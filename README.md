First HTML project

For my first project using the knowledge I have accumulated relating to the HTML language, I will create a basic recipe website. This is not going to be a very visually stunning creation, but the end goal here is functionality. Here in this readme I will describe the process of the trials that I will have gone through to get this project up and running. I will report back once I have finished.
